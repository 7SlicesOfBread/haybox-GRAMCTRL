# HayBox-GRAMCTRL
 Haybox Build for GRAM Controllers.

 For official HayBox Documentation, as well as descriptions of how to build, modify, and use this code, refer to the original documentation [here](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/HayBox).

 *Massive shoutouts to [Johnny Haystack](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack), the goat himself, for building out the HayBox firmware and making it available to all of us. Additional shoutout to [Bloojay](https://github.com/UMS-Ultra) for [Bubblebox-WASD](https://github.com/UMS-Ultra/BubbleBox-Firmware/tree/BubbleBox-WASD-Firmware), the spiritial successor to this modification of the HayBox firmware.*

# Changes made:
- Introduction of a 21st "up2" button that acts as the up button in WASD modes. By default, the button acts as a D-Pad toggle (in the same way ModX+ModY does in the original firmware).
- Made FGC mode in two variants, WASD and traditional leverless, so as to stay Capcom-legal.
- Adjusted FGC mode to include Start, Select, and Home buttons for PS4/5 usage.
